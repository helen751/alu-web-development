# HTML Advanced — Semantic Structure Only

This project implements the **pure HTML semantic structure** of a landing page from a Figma design.  
Per the task requirements, **no CSS** and **no additional assets** beyond semantic HTML are included.  
You can connect your own styles later; this repository focuses strictly on markup that mirrors the wireframe and content blocks specified in the checklist.

## Objectives
- Build the full page skeleton using correct semantic tags.
- Match the sections and nested blocks (header, banner, quote, videos, membership, FAQ, footer).
- Use heading hierarchy appropriately (h1 → h2 → h3).
- Include placeholder images and text elements where images/text are required by the spec.
- Avoid any styling, classes, or external resources not specified.

## Files
- `index.html` — The full page markup.
- `README.md` — This file.
