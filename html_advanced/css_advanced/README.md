# HTML Advanced - Semantic Structure

This project implements the **pure HTML semantic structure** of a landing page based on a provided Figma design.  
The goal of this task is to replicate the wireframe structure using semantic HTML without any CSS or styles. The styles are applied separately using a custom CSS file.

## Objectives
- **HTML Structure**: The primary focus is on constructing the **correct HTML structure** without any additional styling.
- **Semantic Tags**: We use **semantic HTML tags** like `<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, etc., for better accessibility and readability.
- **No CSS**: The styling is handled separately in a CSS file. This is the first step before styling the page with colors, fonts, and layout.
- **Responsiveness**: The layout structure is flexible and will adjust as necessary when CSS is applied later.

## Features Implemented
- **Header**: Includes logo, navigation links, and button for registration.
- **Banner Section**: A hero section with a large heading, introductory text, and a CTA button.
- **Quote Section**: A testimonial with a blockquote and author details.
- **Videos Section**: Displays video tutorials with author names, thumbnails, and ratings.
- **Membership Section**: Flexible membership plans with icons, text, and a registration button.
- **FAQ Section**: Frequently Asked Questions with collapsible or expandable answers.
- **Footer**: Contains a logo, social media links, and footer text.
